This is the libcamera2 port for TouchPad

----------------

Instructions

1. You need to have the CM9 sources patched with several patches from
   gerrit. Use the following script to patch the sources:
   http://pastebin.com/8igJK9WF

2. Download the camerahal sources to the ~/android/system/device/hp/tenderloin
   directory.  

3. Download the libcamera2 sources to the ~/android/system/device/hp/tenderloin
   directory.  

3. Patch the BoardConfig.mk and device_tenderloin.mk with the following 
   changes: http://pastebin.com/g0YaimdL

4. Obtain the libcamera.so and liboemcamera.so from CM7a2.1 build and replace
   the ones from CM9 in: ~/android/system/vendor/hp/tenderloin/proprietary/lib
   The libraries used in CM9 are incorrect and won't load thus there's need to
   use the proper ones from CM7.

5. Run "make clean" before running the first build.

6. Run "brunch tenderloin" to make a build.

7. On the device rename libcamera2.so to libcamera.so in /system/lib to use the
   compiled library instead of the binary one.
